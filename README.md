# Beijing Pollution Analysis Pipeline README
## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based data analysis pipeline specifically designed for analyzing Beijing air pollution data. It includes a comprehensive set of tools for preprocessing data, training multiple linear regression models on subsets of data, and evaluating their performance. This pipeline is particularly useful for environmental data scientists or researchers focusing on air quality studies.

## Features
 - Data Preprocessing: Functions to clean and prepare data for modeling.
 - Model Training: Capabilities to train separate models on different subsets of data.
 - Performance Metrics: Evaluation of models using Mean Squared Error, R-squared, and Adjusted R-squared.
   
## Requirements
 - Python 3.x
 - Pandas
 - Scikit-Learn

## Installation
 1) Clone the repository:
 2) Install the required dependencies:
 3) pip install pandas scikit-learn
    
# Usage
1) Import the pipeline module into your Python script:
2) Prepare your data. Ensure you have the Beijing pollution dataset available in CSV format.
3) Define the wind categories and the target variable for your analysis:
    - winds = ['NE', 'NW', 'SE', 'cv']  # Change as needed
    - target = ['iws']  # Adjust to fit your data and hypothesis
4) Load and preprocess the data using the provided functions.
5) Generate models for each subset of data:
6) Evaluate the models using the printed metrics.
